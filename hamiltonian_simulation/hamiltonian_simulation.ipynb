    "# Hamiltonian Simulation Problem Submission\n",
    "This notebook contains the code to generate my submission for the Classiq Coding Competition's Hamiltonian Simulation Problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disclaimer\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to generate a minimal quantum circuit. It does not in any way aim to do so in a classical efficient way, and a lot of the algorithms used are far from optimized. Since the challenge doesn't seem to care much about the circuit-generating code, I didn't care much either.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Challenge\n",
    "We are given a 10-qubit Hamiltonian that is represented as a linear combination of kronecker products of Pauli operators (276 unique operators in total). The goal of the challenge is to build a quantum circuit with minimal depth to simulate this Hamiltonian under the following constraints:\n",
    "* Use no more than 10 qubits.\n",
    "* Use only single-qubit gates and CNOT gates.\n",
    "* Approximate the Hamiltonian to within 0.1 in the matrix 2-norm (largest singular value norm).\n",
    "More details can be fund in the Classiq website: https://www.classiq.io/competition/hamiltonian#competitionForm\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Approach\n",
    "My approach to this challenge is heavily based around the following article:\n",
    "[Berg, Ewout van den, and Kristan Temme. “Circuit Optimization of Hamiltonian Simulation by Simultaneous Diagonalization of Pauli Clusters.” Quantum, vol. 4, Sept. 2020, p. 322. arXiv.org,](https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2020-09-12-322).\n",
    "The obvious approach, which is also hinted in the challenge's introduction by Classiq, is to implement circuits for the Pauli products and use Trotterization to approximate the full $e^{-iH}$ matrix. Trotterization will add a lot of depth to our circuit, so to minimize this depth we need to:\n",
    "1. Minimize the ammount of Trotter iterations needed to reach at the wanted accuracy.\n",
    "2. Reduce the depth of the circuit implementation of each Pauli product."

    "### Step 1 - Grouping Commuting Paulis\n",
    "Since exponents of commuting matrices commute, we don't need to apply troterrization between commuting Paulis. Therefore, we can group the given Paulis into mutually-commuting groups. We can then implelemnt a circuit for each Pauli in a group and compose them to implement the entire group EXACTLY, since no trotterization is needed within the groups. This approach should greatly reduce the ammount of trotterization needed, and therefore the circuit depth."

    "### Step 2 - Simultaneous Diagonalization\n",
    "Since the Paulis in each group mutually commute, there exists a basis that simultaneously diagnolizes the entire group, turning it into kronecker products of identity matrices and Pauli-Zs. Since the implementation of Pauli-X and Pauli-Y operators basically involve diagnolization and Pauli-Z, we can reduce the circuit depth of eah group by diagonalizing all of its members at the same time instead of doing so seperately for each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm to build a circuit that diagonalizes commuting Paulis is rather involved, and is detailed in the article linked above. This is mearly a python implementation of one of the suggested algorithms found in the article. I did, however, disagree with one of the notions in the article and had to work around it by adding SWAP gates (implemented using CNOT gates as per the challenge constraints).\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure a minimal circuit, I've added a small routine at the end of the algorithm to remove neighbouring Hadamard gates that cancel out, since the algorithm tends to produce them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this step takes a set of commuting Paulis and returns a diagonalizing quantum circuit (containing only CNOT, Hadamard and S gates), and a new set of Paulis consisting of only Identity and Pauli-Z products. Applying the diagnoalizing circuit, the new Paulis, and the inverse of the diagnoalizing circuit, should have the same effect as implementing each Pauli and composing them."

    "### Step 3 - Circuits for the Diagonal Paulis\n",
    "Now we only need to build circuits to run the diagnoal Paulis we got after the previous step. Implementing these Paulis requires only CNOT and RZ gates (except for the global phase Pauli, which requires NOT and Phase gates). To further reduce the circuit depth, we wish to implement a circuit with a minimal amount of CNOT gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we try to reorder the diagonal Paulis in such a way that each Pauli is \"close\" to its neighbours, where being \"close\" means needing a minimal amount of CNOTs. We implement an recursive algorithm to apply minimal changes to the last Pauli we executed and search for a next Pauli that matches these changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing the Pauli-Z products requires CNOTing the qubits and rotating one of them. I chose to always rotate the qubit with the lowest possible index, and CNOT the other qubits to it. This might not be the absolute optimal approach, but it was simple and good enough for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "finally, after handling all Paulis that involve some Pauli-Z, we turn to implement the ones that only involve identitiy matrices, AKA global phases."

For any given number of Trotterization steps $n$, each ordering of the commuting groups results in a different approximation error (unfortunately, in a way I can't predict). By trying random orders in a loop I was lucky enough to find an ordering that produces a small enough error after just 2 steps (surprisingly, this took less than 2 minutes, making me believe its not that rare).\n",
